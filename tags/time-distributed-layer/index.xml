      <description>A project to get me started with machine translation for a personal project that I want to work on later. In this project, we want to train a neural network to translate from english words to french words using a recurrent encoder-decoder structure and then feed it into a time-distributed dense layer.
Create an embedding from english words to tensors Feed into an encoder (GRU network) Pass encoded vector to decoder and train network using teacher forcing (correct the output as it is generated word by word) Copy the weights of the decoder after training to create the final model.</description>
