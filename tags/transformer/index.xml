      <description>In my free time, I do some chinese to english translations for LEMCNSUN on their game Soultide so I was interested in designing a machine learning algorithm that can complete this task. Of course, I have limited processing power with only my laptop and lack of data but it would be cool to tackle these problems and do a proof of concept.
To accomplish this task I hope to:
Find or scrape quality data from the web Look into implementing a transformer for higher quality model Find a good word/character embedding for chinese or create my own with machine learning Experiment with more complex model architecture.</description>
